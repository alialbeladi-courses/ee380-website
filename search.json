Include a clear explanation of the grading error.\n\nDeadline: within 1 week of receiving your grade, by 11:59 PM.\nWe may regrade the entire assignment (your score may go up or down).\n\nLegitimate requests - Points were added incorrectly. - The answer exists but was on a different page. - The grader claims a specific case fails, but your implementation works for that case.\nIllegitimate requests - Disagreeing with the rubric / asking for more partial credit without an error. - “My solution wasn’t clear, but what I meant was correct.”",
