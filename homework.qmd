### Quick checklist (Gradescope)
- Submit **one PDF** (clear scans, high contrast).
- Start **each question on a new page** (recommended).
- Use Gradescope’s tool to map **pages → questions**.
- If the grader cannot read it, they may request a resubmission or deduct points.
- For multi-page answers, link **all relevant pages** to that question.

## Policies

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
### Late days
You have **6 late days** total, with a maximum of **2 late days per assignment**.  
Each late day is a **24-hour extension** (e.g., Wed 11:59 PM → Thu 11:59 PM = 1 late day).  
No credit is given after **48 hours** past the deadline, or after late days are exhausted.

### Collaboration policy and honor code
Students must work **individually** on all homework assignments.  
You may have **high-level discussions** with classmates, but anything you submit must be your own work.

You may reuse small snippets of publicly available code (e.g., StackOverflow) **only if properly attributed**.
:::

::: {.accordion-item}
### Generative AI tools policy
In this course, every element of class assignments must be fully prepared by the student.  
The use of generative AI tools for any part of your work is **not allowed** and will be treated as plagiarism — **unless** it is explicitly permitted and announced by the instructor.
:::

::: {.accordion-item}
### Regrade policy
Regrade requests are submitted through Gradescope. Include a clear explanation of the grading error.

- Deadline: within **1 week** of receiving your grade, by **11:59 PM**.
- We may regrade the entire assignment (your score may go **up or down**).

**Legitimate requests**
- Points were added incorrectly.
- The answer exists but was on a different page.
- The grader claims a specific case fails, but your implementation works for that case.

**Illegitimate requests**
- Disagreeing with the rubric / asking for more partial credit without an error.
- “My solution wasn’t clear, but what I meant was correct.”
