## Step Response

This is a placeholder for the interactive step response simulation. 

*Note: To enable interactivity, we will need to install the `quarto-pyodide` extension.*

### Python Code
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulation code will go here
print("Hello from Pyodide!")
```
